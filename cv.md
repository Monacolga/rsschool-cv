####About myself
For a long time I worked as a sales manager but decided to change the job. In spite of the high outcomes and achievements I wanted to try something new. A few years ago I was interested in the sphere of IT. Having studied in more detail the different directions I stopped at the frontend development. I am confident that my determination and dedication will help me become a competent and sought-after specialist. I believe I have all the necessary skills to achieve success in the area of information.
I enjoy teamwork. I have outgoing personality and good inperpersonal skills. I'm goal-oriented and eager to learn.
In addition, at the end of the course I would like to become a teacher and mentor of the RS-school as I can easily present information and have pedagogical experience and education. On top of that I'm really into it.
