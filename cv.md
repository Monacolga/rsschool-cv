#### About myself

For a long time I worked as a sales manager but decided to change my job. In spite of the high outcomes and achievements I wanted to try something new. A few years ago I was interested in the sphere of IT. Having studied in more detail the different directions I stopped at the frontend development. I am confident that my determination and dedication will help me become a competent and sought-after specialist. I believe I have all the necessary skills to achieve success in the area of information.

I enjoy teamwork. I have outgoing personality and good inperpersonal skills. I'm goal-oriented and eager to learn.
